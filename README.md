#How it works?

The game starts in a loop.
An empty board is displayed with boxes marked successively from 1 to 9.
The field number of player "X" or "O" is taken.
If the player entered an invalid field, an error message is displayed.
Otherwise, the application re-displays the board with the player's move added and checks if the player has won or if there is a tie.
Information about the winner is displayed.
